1. To estimate the number of data nodes(n) :-
            n=H/d
            where n = Number of Data Nodes,
                  H = Initial Data Size,
                  d = Available disk space per node
            Here, H = 600TB
              and d = 7TB
              
              Therefore, n = H/d = 600/7
                         n = 85
           Hence the number of data nodes required are 85.
           
2.  No,the 100 MB of data that is uploaded will not be displayed. Another client would see no content until the whole file is written and
  closed. 
         The reason why the the file will not be accessible until the whole file is written and closed (option D) is because, in order to access
  a file, the request is first sent to the NameNode, to obtain metadata relating to the different blocks that compose the file. This 
  metadata will be written by the NameNode only after it receives confirmation that all blocks of the file were written successfully.
         Therefore, even though the blocks are available, the user can't see the file until the metadata is updated, which is done after 
  all blocks are written.
